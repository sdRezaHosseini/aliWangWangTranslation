# aliWangWangTranslation
Try to translate aliWangWang UI

0- Exit AliWangWang

1- go to C:\Program Files(x86)\TradeManager\languages

2- backup  chs.locale to chs.locale_backup

3- delete chs.dat

4- run "python translateUI.py"  (beside chs.locale)

5- repeat 4th step if needed (each time google translate limit it, wait(change IP !!) and run again! )
	each time we run translateUI.py, it will ignore former translated ans start from last item
	
	
*** It would be easy if you run on linux. Maybe it will need some libraries

*** provided chs.locale is a translated file for version 9.12.07C
